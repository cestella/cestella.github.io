It is an optical isomer of levopropoxyphene. It is intended to treat mild pain and also has antitussive (cough suppressant) and local anaesthetic effects. The drug has been taken off the market in Europe and the US due to concerns of fatal overdoses and heart arrhythmias. Its onset of analgesia (pain relief) is said to be 20\u201330 minutes and peak effects are seen about 1.5\u20132 hours after oral administration.\nDextropropoxyphene is sometimes combined with acetaminophen or aspirin. Trade names include Darvocet-N and Di-Gesic, Darvon with APAP (for dextropropoxyphene and paracetamol) and Darvon with ASA (for dextropropoxyphene and aspirin). The British approved name (i.e. the generic name of the active ingredient) of the paracetamol/dextropropoxyphene preparation is \"co-proxamol\" (sold under a variety of brand names); however, it has been withdrawn since 2007, and is no longer available to new patients, with exceptions. The paracetamol combination(s) are known as Capadex or Di-Gesic in Australia, Lentogesic in South Africa, and Di-Antalvic in France (unlike co-proxamol, which is an approved name, these are all brand names).\nDextropropoxyphene is known under several synonyms, including:\nAlpha-d-4-dimethylamino-3-methyl-1,2-diphenyl-2-butanol propionate\n[(2S,3S)-4-(Dimethylamino)-3- methyl-1,2-diphenylbutan-2-yl] propanoate\n(+)-1,2-Diphenyl-2-propionoxy- 3-methyl-4-di-methylaminobutane\nDesoxypropiophen", "name": "acetaminophen-propoxyphene"}, {"vec": [12.492797209427856, 1.8344998498844487], "type": "rx", "description": "Cetirizine /s\u025b\u02c8t\u026ar\u0268zi\u02d0n/ (trade names Zirtec, Zyrtec, Reactine) is a second-generation antihistamine used in the treatment of hay fever, allergies, angioedema, and urticaria.

Other forms of vitamin B3 include the corresponding amide and nicotinamide (\"niacinamide\"), where the carboxyl group has been replaced by a carboxamide group (CONH\n2), as well as more complex amides and a variety of esters. Nicotinic acid and niacinamide are convertible to each other with steady world demand rising from 8,500 tonnes per year in the 1980s to 40,000 in recent years.\nNiacin cannot be directly converted to nicotinamide, but both compounds are precursors of the coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) in vivo. NAD converts to NADP by phosphorylation in the presence of the enzyme NAD+ kinase. NADP and NAD are coenzymes for many dehydrogenases, participating in many hydrogen transfer processes. NAD is important in catabolism of fat, carbohydrate, protein, and alcohol, as well as cell signaling and DNA repair, and NADP mostly in anabolism reactions such as fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. High energy requirements (brain) or high turnover rate (gut, skin) organs are usually the most susceptible to their deficiency. Although the two are identical in their vitamin activity, nicotinamide does not have the same pharmacological effects (lipid modifying effects) as niacin. Nicotinamide does not reduce cholesterol or cause flushing. Niacin is involved in both DNA repair and the production of steroid hormones in the adrenal gland.\nInsufficient niacin in the diet can cause nausea, skin and mouth lesions, anemia, headaches, and tiredness. Chronic niacin deficiency leads to a disease called pellagra. The lack of niacin may also be observed in pandemic deficiency disease, which is caused by a lack of five crucial vitamins (niacin, vitamin C, thiamin, vitamin D, and vitamin A) and is usually found in areas of widespread poverty and malnutrition.

Ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones are valued for this broad spectrum of activity, excellent tissue penetration, and for their availability in both oral and intravenous formulations.\nCiprofloxacin is used alone or in combination with other antibacterial drugs in the empiric treatment of infections for which the bacterial pathogen has not been identified, including urinary tract infections and abdominal infections among others. It can also treat infections caused by specific pathogens known to be sensitive.\nCiprofloxacin is the most widely used of the second-generation quinolone antibiotics that came into clinical use in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 2010, over 20 million outpatient prescriptions were written for ciprofloxacin, making it the 35th-most commonly prescribed drug, and the 5th-most commonly prescribed antibacterial, in the US. Ciprofloxacin was discovered and developed by Bayer A.G. and subsequently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1987. Ciprofloxacin has 12 FDA-approved human uses and other veterinary uses, but it is often used for unapproved uses (off-label).\nOverall, the safety of ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones appears to be similar to that of other antibiotics, but serious side effects occur on occasion. Some disagreement in the literature exists regarding whether fluoroquinolones produce serious adverse events at a higher rate than other broad-spectrum antibiotics.

It is the first element of group 12 of the periodic table. In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: its ion is of similar size and its only common oxidation state is +2. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth's crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest mineable amounts are found in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc production includes froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).\nBrass, which is an alloy of copper and zinc, has been used since at least the 10th century BC in Judea and by the 7th century BC in Ancient Greece. Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India and was unknown to Europe until the end of the 16th century. The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC. To date, the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar, in Rajasthan, as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc. Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called \"philosopher's wool\" or \"white snow\".\nThe element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke. German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys, such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.\nZinc is an essential mineral perceived by the public today as being of \"exceptional biologic and public health importance\", especially increasingly regarding prenatal and postnatal development. Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases. In children it causes growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, infection susceptibility, and diarrhea. Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry, such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans.

He was among the most dominant and successful Formula One drivers of the modern era and is considered by many as the greatest racing driver of all time.\nSenna began his motorsport career in karting, moving up to open-wheel racing in 1981, and winning the British Formula Three championship in 1983. He made his Formula One debut with Toleman-Hart in 1984 before moving to Lotus-Renault the following year and winning six Grands Prix over the next three seasons. In 1988, he joined Frenchman Alain Prost at McLaren-Honda. Between them, they won all but one of the 16 Grands Prix that year and Senna claimed his first World Championship.

Selenium (Greek \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7 selene meaning \"Moon\") was discovered in 1817 by J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius, who noted the similarity of the new element to the previously known tellurium (named for the Earth).\nSelenium is found impurely in metal sulfide ores, copper where it partially replaces the sulfur. Commercially, selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores, most often during production. Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds are known, but are rare. The chief commercial uses for selenium today are in glassmaking and in pigments. Selenium is a semiconductor and is used in photocells. Uses in electronics, once important, have been mostly supplanted by silicon semiconductor devices. Selenium continues to be used in a few types of DC power surge protectors and one type of fluorescent quantum dot.\nSelenium salts are toxic in large amounts, but trace amounts are necessary for cellular function in many organisms, including all animals, and is an ingredient in many multi-vitamins and other dietary supplements, including infant formula. Selenium is a component of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase (which indirectly reduce certain oxidized molecules in animals and some plants). It is also found in three deiodinase enzymes, which convert one thyroid hormone to another. Selenium requirements in plants differ by species, with some plants requiring relatively large amounts, and others apparently requiring none.", "name": "selenium"}, {"vec": [-3.8017618999320524, -3.6196432969798202], "type": "dx", "description": "Personal history of malignant neoplasm of large intestine", "name": "Personal history of malignant neoplasm of large intestine (ICD-9 v10.05)"}, {"vec": [-8.353902535051962, -6.32565626769386], "type": "dx", "description": "Malignant neoplasm of hepatic flexure", "name": "Malignant neoplasm of hepatic flexure (ICD-9 153)"}, {"vec": [6.237782327380211, 0.9875226619074736], "type": "provider specialty", "description": "Provider specialty of pain medicine", "name": "pain medicine"}, {"vec": [13.99300598222201, 4.841843239853814], "type": "allergic reaction", "description": "modest allergic reaction/respiratory distress", "name": "modest allergic reaction/respiratory distress"}, {"vec": [-5.766717058430049, -2.495647806690084], "type": "dx", "description": "Body Mass Index 38.0-38.9, adult", "name": "Body Mass Index 38.0-38.9, adult (ICD-9 v85.38)"}, {"vec": [-3.6265954453504596, -3.9186919164025267], "type": "dx", "description": "Ulcer of other part of lower limb", "name": "Ulcer of other part of lower limb (ICD-9 707.19)"}, {"vec": [-1.4446712971639695, -2.7190056850974806], "type": "dx", "description": "Spasmodic torticollis", "name": "Spasmodic torticollis (ICD-9 333.83)"}, {"vec": [-8.143041521809318, 2.870820113895444], "type": "dx", "description": "Body Mass Index 34.0-34.9, adult", "name": "Body Mass Index 34.0-34.9, adult (ICD-9 v85.34)"}, {"vec": [7.473168468183356, 5.3468864060701815], "type": "dx", "description": "Ulcer of other part of foot", "name": "Ulcer of other part of foot (ICD-9 707.15)"}, {"vec": [-2.1480630785520742, -5.795589521881134], "type": "dx", "description": "Volume depletion, unspecified", "name": "Volume depletion, unspecified (ICD-9 276.50)"}, {"vec": [0.49397685639935524, 4.592949751892131], "type": "dx", "description": "Adhesive capsulitis of shoulder", "name": "Adhesive capsulitis of shoulder (ICD-9 726.0)"}, {"vec": [3.0581928351305026, -3.197615753537379], "type": "dx", "description": "Ego-dystonic sexual orientation", "name": "Ego-dystonic sexual orientation (ICD-9 302.0)"}, {"vec": [5.1521806348324475, 2.657040637433332], "type": "dx", "description": "Other affections of shoulder region, not elsewhere classified", "name": "Other affections of shoulder region, not elsewhere classified (ICD-9 726.2)"}, {"vec": [5.933922302918833, -5.705357748470334], "type": "dx", "description": "Genital herpes, unspecified", "name": "Genital herpes, unspecified (ICD-9 054.10)"}, {"vec": [-2.5682630578386396, -6.408718662348119], "type": "dx", "description": "Senile corneal changes", "name": "Senile corneal changes (ICD-9 371.41)"}, {"vec": [-4.7487338592424475, 4.770466373086241], "type": "dx", "description": "Unspecified thrombosed hemorrhoids", "name": "Unspecified thrombosed hemorrhoids (ICD-9 455.7)"}, {"vec": [11.024471637878882, 3.5004680291578656], "type": "rx", "description": "Brompheniramine (Bromfed, Dimetapp, Bromfenex, Dimetane, BPN, Lodrane), commonly marketed as its salt brompheniramine maleate, is an antihistamine drug of the propylamine (alkylamine) class.

Because of its potent activity against the common respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, it is considered a \"respiratory quinolone.\"\nA United States patent application was submitted on 30 June 1989, for Avelox (moxifloxacin hydrochloride). In 1999 Avelox was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States.\nIn the United States, moxifloxacin is licensed for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community acquired pneumonia, complicated and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, and complicated intra-abdominal infections. In the European Union, it is licensed for acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, non-severe community-acquired pneumonia, and acute bacterial sinusitis. Based on its investigation into reports of rare but severe cases of liver toxicity and skin reactions, the European Medicines Agency recommended in 2008 that the use of the oral (but not the IV) form of moxifloxacin be restricted to infections in which other antibacterial agents cannot be used or have failed. In the US, the marketing approval does not contain these restrictions, though the label contains prominent warnings against skin reactions.\nAvelox (moxifloxacin) was launched in the United States in 1999 and is currently marketed in more than 80 countries worldwide. In the United States, Avelox is marketed by Bayer's partner Merck.\nIn 2011 the FDA added two boxed warnings for this drug in reference to spontaneous tendon ruptures and the fact that moxifloxacin may cause worsening of myasthenia gravis symptoms, including muscle weakness and life-threatening breathing problems.", "name": "moxifloxacin ophthalmic"}, {"vec": [1.9594144206548392, -7.800129483005976], "type": "dx", "description": "Inguinal hernia, without mention of obstruction or gangrene, unilateral or unspecified (not specified as recurrent)", "name": "Inguinal hernia, without mention of obstruction or gangrene, unilateral or unspecified (not specified as recurrent) (ICD-9 550.9)"}, {"vec": [-7.14979378160063, 5.921732963229914], "type": "dx", "description": "Multiple myeloma, in remission", "name": "Multiple myeloma, in remission (ICD-9 203.01)"}, {"vec": [4.8589447064718305, 6.854264359963936], "type": "dx", "description": "Persistent disorder of initiating or maintaining wakefulness", "name": "Persistent disorder of initiating or maintaining wakefulness (ICD-9 307.44)"}, {"vec": [-10.274087348736135, -4.185067116867106], "type": "dx", "description": "Viral hepatitis A with hepatic coma", "name": "Viral hepatitis A with hepatic coma (ICD-9 070)"}, {"vec": [-4.570749354594141, 5.9856848754777205], "type": "dx", "description": "Sleep arousal disorder", "name": "Sleep arousal disorder (ICD-9 307.46)"}, {"vec": [4.617375912407564, 2.183901547802234], "type": "dx", "description": "Nonorganic sleep disorder, unspecified", "name": "Nonorganic sleep disorder, unspecified (ICD-9 307.40)"}, {"vec": [4.842196604174829, -2.2160943817780643], "type": "dx", "description": "Persistent disorder of initiating or maintaining sleep", "name": "Persistent disorder of initiating or maintaining sleep (ICD-9 307.42)"}, {"vec": [-6.5677557601094945, -5.166955439538546], "type": "dx", "description": "Malignant neoplasm of uterine adnexa, unspecified site", "name": "Malignant neoplasm of uterine adnexa, unspecified site (ICD-9 183.9)"}, {"vec": [-3.7447104921643177, 0.17617404704421377], "type": "dx", "description": "Bronchiectasis without acute exacerbation", "name": "Bronchiectasis without acute exacerbation (ICD-9 494.0)"}, {"vec": [-3.1956622714079055, 3.52102974503269], "type": "dx", "description": "Gastroesophageal laceration-hemorrhage syndrome", "name": "Gastroesophageal laceration-hemorrhage syndrome (ICD-9 530.7)"}, {"vec": [-2.2673770364292825, 2.0056886993028002], "type": "dx", "description": "Dyskinesia of esophagus", "name": "Dyskinesia of esophagus (ICD-9 530.5)"}, {"vec": [7.420303731809528, -1.2594527644417937], "type": "rx", "description": "Dextroamphetamine is a potent central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and amphetamine stereoisomer prescribed for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy.

Methylphenidate has been studied and researched for over 50 years and has a very good efficacy and safety record for the treatment of ADHD. The original patent was owned by CIBA, now Novartis Corporation. It was first licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1955 for treating what was then known as hyperactivity.\nPrescribed to patients beginning in 1960, the drug has become increasingly prescribed since the 1990s, when the diagnosis of ADHD itself became more widely accepted. Between 2007 and 2012 methylphenidate prescriptions increased by 50% in Britain and in 2013 global methylphenidate consumption increased to 2.4 billion doses, a 66% increase compared to the year before. The US continues to account for more than 80% of global consumption.\nADHD and other similar conditions are believed to be linked to sub-performance of the dopamine and norepinephrine functions in the brain, primarily in the prefrontal cortex, responsible for self-regulatory function (e.g., inhibition, motivation, and memory) and executive function (e.g., reasoning, organizing, problem solving, and planning). Methylphenidate's mechanism of action involves the inhibition of catecholamine reuptake, primarily as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Methylphenidate acts by blocking the dopamine transporter and norepinephrine transporter, leading to increased concentrations of dopamine and norepinephrine within the synaptic cleft. This effect in turn leads to increased neurotransmission of dopamine and norepinephrine.

It is a short-acting nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic of the imidazopyridine class that potentiates GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, by binding to GABAA receptors at the same location as benzodiazepines. It works quickly, usually within 15 minutes, and has a short half-life of two to three hours.\nZolpidem has not adequately demonstrated effectiveness in maintaining sleep, unless delivered in a controlled-release (CR) form. However, it is effective in initiating sleep. Its hypnotic effects are similar to those of the benzodiazepine class of drugs, but it is molecularly distinct from the classical benzodiazepine molecule and is classified as an imidazopyridine. Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, which is used for benzodiazepine overdose, can also reverse zolpidem's sedative/hypnotic and memory-impairing effects.\nZolpidem has slight muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant properties, but has not been approved for use in muscle relaxation or seizure prevention. This is because the dosage of drug needed to cause muscle relaxation is 10 times the sedating dose, and the dosage needed for preventing seizures is 20 times the sedating dose; high dosages are more likely to cause unpleasant side effects such as hallucinations and amnesia. Contrary to early studies, more recent research has indicated that zolpidem is in fact a potent anticonvulsant. The anticonvulsant effects are not realized until the normal dosage range has been surpassed (meaning sedation would still be a major side effect) but the threshold for this effect is now believed to be considerably lower than original estimates.\nThe United States patent for zolpidem was held by the French pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis. On April 23, 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 13 generic versions of zolpidem tartrate. Zolpidem is available from several generic manufacturers in the UK, as a generic from Sandoz in South Africa and TEVA in Israel, as well as from other manufacturers such as Ratiopharm and Takeda GmbH (both Germany).\nOn January 10, 2013, the Food and Drug Administration announced it is requiring the manufacturer of Ambien and Zolpimist to cut the recommended dosage for women in half, after laboratory studies showed that the medicines can leave patients drowsy in the morning and at risk for motor vehicle collisions. The FDA recommended that manufacturers extend the new dosage cuts to men as well, who process the drug at a faster rate; however, the reasons men and women metabolize the drugs at different rates are still unknown. In May 2013, the FDA approved label changes specifying new dosage recommendations for zolpidem products because of concerns regarding next-morning impairment.", "name": "zolpidem"}, {"vec": [-6.680885549851951, -7.888240108834252], "type": "dx", "description": "Redundant prepuce and phimosis", "name": "Redundant prepuce and phimosis (ICD-9 605)"}, {"vec": [-5.745133819620364, 9.539252011267369], "type": "dx", "description": "Acute tonsillitis", "name": "Acute tonsillitis (ICD-9 463)"}, {"vec": [-8.551736770870146, -3.3631744906658705], "type": "dx", "description": "dx::285.200", "name": "dx::285.200 (ICD-9 285.2)"}, {"vec": [7.468602452494155, 5.367389515288555], "type": "dx", "description": "Bunion", "name": "Bunion (ICD-9 727.1)"}, {"vec": [-5.473967877439208, 1.5395378412010072], "type": "dx", "description": "Other bursitis", "name": "Other bursitis (ICD-9 727.3)"}, {"vec": [-5.540227562480821, -3.142306934316324], "type": "dx", "description": "Mitral and aortic valve diseases, unspecified", "name": "Mitral and aortic valve diseases, unspecified (ICD-9 396.9)"}, {"vec": [-1.3844224355957846, 0.5563537439433331], "type": "dx", "description": "Malignant neoplasm of thyroid gland", "name": "Malignant neoplasm of thyroid gland (ICD-9 193)"}, {"vec": [-2.3178708733652456, -4.782458194034114], "type": "dx", "description": "Macroglossia", "name": "Macroglossia (ICD-9 750.15)"}, {"vec": [2.1862149908586797, 0.21362887481494908], "type": "dx", "description": "Epilepsy, unspecified, without mention of intractable epilepsy", "name": "Epilepsy, unspecified, without mention of intractable epilepsy (ICD-9 345.9)"}, {"vec": [-8.033762093881656, -7.606273240794235], "type": "dx", "description": "Postinflammatory pulmonary fibrosis", "name": "Postinflammatory pulmonary fibrosis (ICD-9 515)"}, {"vec": [0.48349075902404687, -2.7479682737520097], "type": "dx", "description": "Sudden hearing loss, unspecified", "name": "Sudden hearing loss, unspecified (ICD-9 388.2)"}, {"vec": [7.9481698562496215, -0.49099784039664773], "type": "rx", "description": "Lorazepam (trademarked as Ativan or Orfidal) is a high-potency, intermediate-duration, 3-hydroxy benzodiazepine drug, often used to treat anxiety disorders.

Lorazepam is used for the short-term treatment of anxiety, insomnia, acute seizures including status epilepticus, and sedation of hospitalized patients, as well as sedation of aggressive patients. Lorazepam is also the most common benzodiazepine used to decrease the likelihood of agitation and seizures in patients who have overdosed on stimulant drugs.\nAfter its introduction in 1977, lorazepam's main use was to treat anxiety. Among benzodiazepines, lorazepam has a relatively high physical addiction potential. Lorazepam also has misuse potential; the main types of misuse are for recreational purposes or continued use against medical advice.\nLong-term effects of benzodiazepines include tolerance, dependence, benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, and cognitive impairments which may not completely reverse after stopping treatment; however, for most patients, cognitive impairment is not severe. Withdrawal symptoms can range from anxiety and insomnia to seizures and psychosis. Due to tolerance and dependence, lorazepam is recommended for short-term use, up to two to four weeks only. Adverse effects, including inability to form new memories, depression, and paradoxical effects, such as excitement or worsening of seizures, may occur.

It was initially introduced in 1948 as a pesticide against rats and mice, and is still used for this purpose, although more potent poisons such as brodifacoum have since been developed. In the early 1950s, warfarin was found to be effective and relatively safe for preventing thrombosis and thromboembolism in many disorders. It was approved for use as a medication in 1954, and has remained popular ever since. Warfarin is the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulant drug in North America.\nDespite its effectiveness, treatment with warfarin has several shortcomings. Many commonly used medications interact with warfarin, as do some foods (particularly leaf vegetable foods or \"greens,\" since these typically contain large amounts of vitamin K1) and its activity has to be monitored by blood testing for the international normalized ratio (INR) to ensure an adequate yet safe dose is taken. A high INR predisposes patients to an increased risk of bleeding, while an INR below the therapeutic target indicates the dose of warfarin is insufficient to protect against thromboembolic events.\nWarfarin and related 4-hydroxycoumarin-containing molecules decrease blood coagulation by inhibiting vitamin K epoxide reductase, an enzyme that recycles oxidized vitamin K1 to its reduced form after it has participated in the carboxylation of several blood coagulation proteins, mainly prothrombin and factor VII. Despite being labeled a vitamin K antagonist, warfarin does not antagonize the action of vitamin K1, but rather antagonizes vitamin K1 recycling, depleting active vitamin K1. Thus, the pharmacologic action may always be reversed by fresh vitamin K1. When administered, these drugs do not anticoagulate blood immediately. Instead, onset of their effect requires about two to three days before remaining active clotting factors have had time to naturally disappear in metabolism, and the duration of action of a single dose of warfarin is 2 to 5 days. Reversal of warfarin's effect by discontinuing its use, or by administering vitamin K1, requires a similar period of time.\nWarfarin is a synthetic derivative of dicoumarol, a 4-hydroxycoumarin-derived mycotoxin anticoagulant originally discovered in spoiled sweet clover-based animal feeds. Dicoumarol, in turn, is derived from coumarin, a sweet-smelling but coagulation-inactive chemical found naturally in \"sweet\" clover (to which it gives its odor and name), tonka beans (also known as \"cumaru\" from which coumarin's name derives), and many other plants. The name 'warfarin' stems from its discovery at the University of Wisconsin, incorporating the acronym for the organization that funded the key research, \"WARF\" for the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the ending \"-arin\", indicating its link with coumarin.", "name": "warfarin"}, {"vec": [12.768899889028066, -4.654622007178821], "type": "rx", "description": "Hydralazine (Apresoline) is a direct-acting smooth muscle relaxant used to treat hypertension by acting as a vasodilator primarily in arteries and arterioles.

In this study, only chlortalidone significantly reduced the risk of combined cardiovascular disease events, especially heart failure, when compared with drugs such as doxazosin. Chlortalidone was approved by the FDA in 1960.

It is a structural analog of phenobarbital and related to barbiturate-derivative anticonvulsants. The active metabolites, phenobarbital, p-hydroxyphenobarbital, and phenylethylmalonamide are also anticonvulsants. It is used mainly to treat complex partial, simple partial, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonic, and akinetic seizures. Since the 1980s it has been a valuable alternative to propranolol in the treatment of essential tremor. Unlike other anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine and valproic acid, primidone is rarely used in the treatment of bipolar disorder or any other psychiatric problem, although this presents a risk for the worsening of some disorders. It is also occasionally used in treatment of neuropathic pain, trigeminal neuralgia, and migraine. Primidone has been occasionally used to treat long QT syndrome, cerebral palsy, and athetosis.\nPrimidone was once a mainstay anticonvulsant in the treatment of partial and generalized seizures and was the treatment of choice for secondarily generalized seizures originating in the temporal lobes, especially when combined with phenytoin, but by the early 1980s, carbamazepine had surpassed it in popularity due to the latter's lower incidence of sedation. As time passed and more and more anticonvulsants came on the market, primidone was pushed further and further away from its former place of prominence and major Western pharmaceutical corporations became less and less interested in manufacturing and selling it. It has largely fallen into disuse in the developed world as more and more anticonvulsants entered the market and has been withdrawn from markets all over the world.\nUnlike many other anticonvulsants, primidone works via interactions with voltage-gated sodium channels which inhibit high-frequency repetitive firing of action potentials. It is much less toxic in overdose than phenobarbital. Along with carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin, primidone is an inducer of metabolic enzymes in the liver, which means that it accelerates the metabolism of many other pharmaceuticals. Like other anticonvulsants that entered the market before 1989, primidone has been associated with hyperhomocysteinemia, folate deficiency and its various symptoms (birth defects, depression, and megaloblastic anemia), reduced calcium absorption, and various bone diseases.

While estrogen levels in men are lower compared to women, estrogens have essential functions in men as well.

Chemically, the substance is an organic nitrate compound rather than a nitro compound, yet the traditional name is often retained. Invented in 1847, nitroglycerin has been used as an active ingredient in the manufacture of explosives, mostly dynamite, and as such it is employed in the construction, demolition, and mining industries. Since the 1880s, it has been used by the military as an active ingredient, and a gelatinizer for nitrocellulose, in some solid propellants, such as cordite and ballistite.\nNitroglycerin is also a major component in double-based smokeless gunpowders used by reloaders. Combined with nitrocellulose, there are hundreds of (powder) combinations used by rifle, pistol, and shotgun reloaders.\nFor over 130 years, nitroglycerin has been used medically as a potent vasodilator to treat heart conditions, such as angina pectoris and chronic heart failure. Though it was previously known that these beneficial effects are due to nitroglycerin being converted to nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator, it was not until 2002 that the enzyme for this conversion was discovered to be mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase.

In this study, only chlortalidone significantly reduced the risk of combined cardiovascular disease events, especially heart failure, when compared with drugs such as doxazosin.

For high blood pressure it is often recommended as a first line treatment. HCTZ is taken by mouth and may be combined with other blood pressure medications as a single pill to increase the effectiveness.\nPotential side effects include poor kidney function, electrolyte imbalances especially low blood potassium and less commonly low blood sodium, gout, high blood sugar, and feeling faint initially upon standing up. While allergies to HCTZ are reported to occur more often in those with allergies to sulfa drugs this association is not well supported.

Levofloxacin is used alone or in combination with other antibacterial drugs to treat certain bacterial infections including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and abdominal infections.\nLevofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones are generally well tolerated, but in rare instances have produced serious adverse reactions such as spontaneous tendon ruptures and irreversible peripheral neuropathy.

Because of its antihistamine effects it can also be used for the treatment of severe cases of itching, hyperalgesia and motion sickness-induced nausea, it has also been used in some cases to relieve the effects of opioid withdrawal. Even though it is an effective sedative, hypnotic, and anxiolytic, it allegedly shares virtually none of the abuse, dependence, addiction, and toxicity potential of other drugs used for the same range of therapeutic reasons. Hydroxyzine has also been used to potentiate the analgesia of opioids and to alleviate some of their side effects, such as itching, nausea, and vomiting.\nHydroxyzine preparations usually require a doctor's prescription. The drug is available in two formulations, the pamoate and the dihydrochloride or hydrochloride salts. Vistaril, Equipose, Masmoran, and Paxistil are preparations of the pamoate salt, while Atarax, Alamon, Aterax, Durrax, Tran-Q, Orgatrax, Quiess, and Tranquizine are of the hydrochloride salt.\nOther drugs related to hydroxyzine are cyclizine, buclizine, and meclizine, and they share all or most of the benefits, indications, contraindications, cautions, and side effects of hydroxyzine. The second-generation antihistamine cetirizine is in fact one of the metabolites of hydroxyzine produced in the human body. Unlike hydroxyzine, cetirizine is not reported to appreciably cross the blood-brain barrier, but it has been reported to be associated with dystonic reactions as well as sedation. Therefore, it has a narrower spectrum of effects, making it an effective antihistamine but removing some or all of the anxiolytic and other psychoactive properties, but it may cause dystonic reactions and drowsiness in some patients.", "name": "hydroxyzine"}, {"vec": [12.520001992079434, -2.540817824796656], "type": "rx", "description": "Amlodipine (as besylate, mesylate or maleate) is a medication used to lower blood pressure and prevent chest pain.

Furosemide is incompletely absorbed in the intestine (60%), and there are substantial inter- and intraindividual differences in bioavailability (range 10-90%). Bumetanide is almost completely absorbed (80%), and the absorption is not altered when it is taken with food. It is said to be a more predictable diuretic, meaning that the predictable absorption is reflected in a more predictable effect.\nBumetanide is 40 times more potent than furosemide for patients with normal renal function.\nIn the brain, bumetanide blocks the NKCC1 cation-chloride co-transporter, and thus decreases internal chloride concentration in neurons. In turn, this concentration change makes the action of GABA more hyperpolarizing, which may be useful for treatment of neonatal seizures, that quite often are not responsive to traditional GABA-targeted treatment, such as barbiturates.

Morphine is also frequently used for pain from myocardial infarction and during labour. It can be administered orally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intravenously, into the space around the spinal cord, or rectally. Maximum effect is around 20 min when given intravenously and 60 min when given by mouth while duration of effect is between three and seven hours. Long acting formulations also exist.\nPotentially serious side effects include a decreased respiratory effort and low blood pressure. Morphine has a high potential for addiction and abuse. If the dose is reduced after long term use withdrawal may occur. Common side effects include drowsiness, vomiting, and constipation. Caution is advised when used during pregnancy or breast feeding as morphine will affect the infant.\nMorphine was first isolated between 1803 and 1805 by Friedrich Sert\u00fcrner. This is generally believed to be the first isolation of an active ingredient from a plant. Merck began marketing it commercially in 1827. Morphine was more widely used after the invention of the hypodermic syringe in 1853\u20131855. Sert\u00fcrner originally named the substance morphium after the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus, for its tendency to cause sleep.\nThe primary source of morphine is isolation from poppy straw of the opium poppy. In 2013 an estimated 523,000 kilograms of morphine were produced. About 45,000 kilograms were used directly for pain, an increase over the last twenty years of four times. Most use for this purpose was in the developed world. About 70% of morphine is used to make other opioids such as hydromorphone, oxycodone, heroin, and methadone.

Phenobarbital produces sedation by increasing the proportion of bound GABA receptors that are in the long-duration active state.\nThe World Health Organization recommends phenobarbital as a first-line medication for partial and generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures in developing countries.

It is occasionally used to treat an inability to sleep, anxiety and to help with drug withdrawal as well as surgery.,\nSide effects include a decreased level of consciousness along with a decreased effort to breathe.

However, gentamicin is not used for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, or Legionella pneumophila. Gentamicin is also ototoxic and nephrotoxic, with this toxicity remaining a major problem in clinical use.\nIt is synthesized by Micromonospora, a genus of Gram-positive bacteria widely present in the environment (water and soil). To highlight their specific biological origins, gentamicin and other related antibiotics produced by this genus (verdamicin, mutamicin, sisomicin, netilmicin, retymicin) generally have their spellings ending in ~micin and not in ~mycin. Gentamicin is a bactericidal antibiotic that works by binding the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, interrupting protein synthesis.\nLike all aminoglycosides, when gentamicin is given orally, it is not systemically active. This is because it is not absorbed to any appreciable extent from the small intestine. It is administered intravenously, intramuscularly or topically to treat infections. It appears to be completely eliminated unchanged in the urine. Urine must be collected for many days to recover all of a given dose because the drug binds avidly to certain tissues.\nE. coli has shown some resistance to gentamicin, despite being Gram-negative. Reluctance to use gentamicin for empirical therapy has led to increased use of alternative broad-spectrum antibiotics, which some experts suggest has led to the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections by MRSA and other so-called \"superbugs\".\nGentamicin is one of the few heat-stable antibiotics that remain active even after autoclaving, which makes it particularly useful in the preparation of some microbiological growth media.

They recommend its use to prevent infection in at-risk people but not the general population. The CDC recommends that clinicians use their discretion to treat those at lower risk who present within 48 hours of first symptoms of infection. However, these recommendations are controversial as are criticisms of the recommendations. A Cochrane review concluded that oseltamivir does not reduce hospitalizations, and that there is no evidence of reduction in complications of influenza (such as pneumonia) because of a lack of diagnostic definitions, or reduction of the spread of the virus. Two meta-analyses have concluded that benefits in those who are otherwise healthy do not outweigh its risks. They also found little evidence regarding whether treatment changes the risk of hospitalization or death in high risk populations.

The World Health Organization (WHO), as well as public health officials in Australia, Canada, Europe, and the United States recommend vaccination of young women against HPV. HPV vaccination is also effective in males to protect their partners from HPV infections, as well as themselves from anal cancer and genital warts, and possibly other HPV associated cancers.\nTwo vaccines have market approval in many countries as of 2014 (called Gardasil and Cervarix in the US). Both vaccines protect against the two HPV types (HPV-16 and HPV-18) that cause 70% of cervical cancers, 80% of anal cancers, 60% of vaginal cancers, and 40% of vulvar cancers. These HPV types also cause most HPV induced oral cancers, and some other rare genital cancers. Gardasil also protects against the two HPV types (HPV-6 and HPV-11) that cause 90% of genital warts. Both vaccines have been shown to prevent precancerous lesions of the cervix. Gardasil has been shown to prevent precursors to anal, vulvar, vaginal, and penile cancers. HPV vaccines are expected to protect against HPV induced cancers of these areas as well as HPV induced oral cancers. In December 2014, the United States' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a vaccine called Gardasil 9 to protect females between the ages of 9 and 26 and males between the ages of 9 and 15 against nine strains of HPV. Gardasil 9 protects against infection with the strains covered by the first generation of Gardasil (HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18) and protects against five other HPV strains responsible for 20% of cervical cancers (HPV-31, HPV-33, HPV-45, HPV-52, and HPV-58).\nWorldwide, HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in adults. For example, more than 80% of American women will have contracted at least one strain of HPV by age fifty. Although most women infected with genital HPV will not have complications from the virus, worldwide there are an estimated 529,000 new cases of cervical cancer and 275,000 deaths per year. About 85 percent of cancers, and 80% of deaths from cervical cancer occur in developing countries. In the United States, most of the approximately 11,000 cervical cancers found annually occur in women who have never had a Pap smear, or did not follow up on abnormal Pap smear results. HPV is also the cause of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). CIN is a precursor to cervical cancer, and is painful and costly to treat. It is not known how many women worldwide are diagnosed with CIN.\nSince the vaccine only covers some high-risk types of HPV, experts still recommend that women get Pap smear screenings even after vaccination. In the US, the recommendation is for women to receive routine Pap smears beginning at age 21.

About 60% of people improve with any given NSAID and it is recommended that if one does not work that another should be tried. Ibuprofen might be considered a weaker anti-inflammatory than other NSAIDs.\nCompared to other NSAIDs it may have fewer side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding. At low doses it does not appear to increase the risk of myocardial infarction; however, at higher doses it may. It may result in worsened asthma.\nLike other NSAIDs, it works by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are fat-like molecules derived from arachidonic acid, which are involved in mediating inflammation (swelling), pain, and fever. It achieves this effect on prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, an enzyme that is present in various tissues of the body.\nIt was originally made and patented in 1961, by the research arm of Boots Company led by Stewart Adams and marketed as Brufen. Ibuprofen is now available under a variety of trade names, with the most notable being Advil, Motrin, and Nurofen. Its discovery was the result of research during the 1950s and 1960s to find a safer alternative to aspirin. It was later marketed, in 1966, as a prescription drug in the United Kingdom, then the United States in 1974. Later in 1983 and 1984, it became the first NSAID (other than aspirin) to be available over the counter (OTC) in these two countries.

Urea is also an important raw material for the chemical industry.\nThe discovery by Friedrich W\u00f6hler in 1828 that urea can be produced from inorganic starting materials was an important conceptual milestone in chemistry, as it showed for the first time that a substance previously known only as a byproduct of life could be synthesized in the laboratory without any biological starting materials, contradicting the widely held doctrine of vitalism.", "name": "urea topical"}, {"vec": [-1.3462524928077928, 7.6515297297379945], "type": "dx", "description": "Closed fracture of rib(s), unspecified", "name": "Closed fracture of rib(s), unspecified (ICD-9 807.0)"}, {"vec": [7.993277523892511, -2.766061091681246], "type": "rx", "description": "Buprenorphine is a semisynthetic opioid derivative of thebaine.

It remained the antimalarial drug of choice until the 1940s, when other drugs, such as chloroquine, that have fewer unpleasant side effects replaced it. Since then, many effective antimalarials have been introduced, although quinine is still used to treat the disease in certain critical circumstances, such as severe malaria, and in impoverished regions, due to its low cost. Quinine is available with a prescription in the United States and \"over-the-counter\" (in minute quantities) in tonic water. Quinine is also used to treat lupus and arthritis. Quinine was also frequently prescribed in the US as an off-label treatment for nocturnal leg cramps, but this has become less prevalent due to a Food and Drug Administration statement warning against the practice.\nQuinine is highly fluorescent (quantum yield ~0.58) in 0.1 M sulfuric acid solution and it is widely used as a standard for fluorescence quantum yield measurement.

It is also referred to as vitamin M, vitamin B9, vitamin Bc (or folacin), pteroyl-L-glutamic acid, and pteroyl-L-glutamate.\nFood supplement manufacturers often use the term folate for something different from \"pure\" folic acid: in chemistry, folate refers to the deprotonated ion, and folic acid to the neutral molecule\u2014which both co-exist in water. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry and the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology state that folate and folic acid are the preferred synonyms for pteroylglutamate and pteroylglutamic acid, respectively.\nFolate indicates a collection of \"folates\" that is not chemically well-characterized, including other members of the family of pteroylglutamates, or mixtures of them, having various levels of reduction of the pteridine ring, one-carbon substitutions and different numbers of glutamate residues.\nFolic acid is synthetically produced, and used in fortified foods and supplements. Folate is converted by humans to dihydrofolate (dihydrofolic acid), tetrahydrofolate (tetrahydrofolic acid), and other derivatives, which have various biological activities. \nVitamin B9 is essential for numerous bodily functions. Humans cannot synthesize folates de novo; therefore, folic acid has to be supplied through the diet to meet their daily requirements. The human body needs folate to synthesize DNA, repair DNA, and methylate DNA as well as to act as a cofactor in certain biological reactions. It is especially important in aiding rapid cell division and growth, such as in infancy and pregnancy. Children and adults both require folate to produce healthy red blood cells and prevent anemia.\nFolate and folic acid derive their names from the Latin word folium, which means \"leaf\". Folates occur naturally in many foods and, among plants, are especially plentiful in dark green leafy vegetables.\nA lack of dietary folates can lead to folate deficiency. A complete lack of dietary folate takes months before deficiency develops as normal individuals have about 500\u201320,000 \u00b5g of folate in body stores. This deficiency can result in many health problems, the most notable one being neural tube defects in developing embryos\u2014a relatively rare birth defect affecting only 300,000 (0.002%) of births globally each year. Common symptoms of folate deficiency include diarrhea, macrocytic anemia with weakness or shortness of breath, nerve damage with weakness and limb numbness (peripheral neuropathy), pregnancy complications, mental confusion, forgetfulness or other cognitive deficits, mental depression, sore or swollen tongue, peptic or mouth ulcers, headaches, heart palpitations, irritability, and behavioral disorders. Low levels of folate can also lead to homocysteine accumulation. Low levels of folate have been associated with specific cancers. However, it is not clear whether consuming recommended (or higher) amounts of folic acid\u2014from foods or in supplements\u2014can lower cancer risk in some people.", "name": "folic"}, {"vec": [-6.905048236829468, -1.755451609458889], "type": "dx", "description": "Anxiety disorder in conditions classified elsewhere", "name": "Anxiety disorder in conditions classified elsewhere (ICD-9 293.84)"}, {"vec": [-5.301424886444452, -0.04602546879322231], "type": "dx", "description": "Contusion of multiple sites, not elsewhere classified", "name": "Contusion of multiple sites, not elsewhere classified (ICD-9 924.8)"}, {"vec": [-2.925038102602277, -4.2277641891385525], "type": "dx", "description": "Cauda equina syndrome with neurogenic bladder", "name": "Cauda equina syndrome with neurogenic bladder (ICD-9 344.61)"}, {"vec": [-1.9851708691264967, 3.9961309370536338], "type": "dx", "description": "Unspecified gingival and periodontal disease", "name": "Unspecified gingival and periodontal disease (ICD-9 523.9)"}, {"vec": [14.471662265683884, 0.25615381477751226], "type": "rx", "description": "Cortisol is a steroid hormone, in the glucocorticoid class of hormones, and is produced in humans by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex within the adrenal gland.

Aspirin also has an antiplatelet effect by inhibiting the production of thromboxane, which under normal circumstances binds platelet molecules together to create a patch over damaged walls of blood vessels. Because the platelet patch can become too large and also block blood flow, locally and downstream, aspirin is also used long-term, at low doses, to help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and blood clot formation in people at high risk of developing blood clots. Also, low doses of aspirin may be given immediately after a heart attack to reduce the risk of another heart attack or of the death of cardiac tissue. Aspirin may be effective at preventing certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.\nThe main side effects of aspirin are gastrointestinal ulcers, stomach bleeding, and ringing in the ears, especially with higher doses. In children and adolescents, aspirin is not recommended for flu-like symptoms or viral illnesses, because of the risk of Reye's syndrome.\nAspirin is part of a group of medications called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but differs from most other NSAIDs in the mechanism of action. Though it and others with similar structure, called the salicylates, have similar effects (antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic) to the other NSAIDs and inhibit the same enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), aspirin does so in an irreversible manner and, unlike others, affects more the COX-1 variant than the COX-2 variant of the enzyme.\nAspirin is based on salicylin, a chemical found in the bark of the willow tree. The therapeutic properties of willow tree bark have been known for at least 2,400 years, with Hippocrates prescribing it for headaches. Bark containing salicin was used by the Romans and American Indians to treat cold, flu, aches, pains and infections. Salicylic acid, the active ingredient of aspirin, was first discovered from the bark of the willow tree in 1763 by Edward Stone of Wadham College, University of Oxford. Felix Hoffmann, a chemist with the German company Bayer, is credited with the synthesis of aspirin in 1897, though whether this was of his own initiative or under the direction of Arthur Eichengr\u00fcn is controversial. Many historians believe Arthur Eichengr\u00fcn to be the true inventor.

The first of the atypical antipsychotics to be developed, it was first introduced in Europe in 1971, but was voluntarily withdrawn by the manufacturer in 1975 after it was shown to cause agranulocytosis, a condition involving a dangerous decrease in the number of white blood cells, that led to death in some patients. In 1989 after studies demonstrated that it was effective in treating treatment-resistant schizophrenia the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of clozapine solely for that use, requiring regular white blood cell and absolute neutrophil counts. The FDA also requires clozapine to carry five black box warnings for agranulocytosis, seizures, myocarditis, for \"other adverse cardiovascular and respiratory effects\", and for \"increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis.\" In 2002 the FDA approved clozapine for reducing the risk of suicidal behavior for patients with schizophrenia.\nClozapine is usually used only in patients that have not responded to other anti-psychotic treatments due to its danger of causing agranulocytosis as well as the costs of having to have blood tests continually during treatment. It is, however, one of the most effective anti-psychotic treatment choices. Patients are monitored weekly for the first six months. If there are no low counts the patient can be monitored every two weeks for an additional six months. Afterwards, the patient may qualify for every four-week monitoring. Clozapine has numerous severe side effects including agranulocytosis, and seizures, and has been associated with myocarditis and diabetes though those relationships have not been confirmed. Additionally, it also often causes less serious side effects such as hypersalivation and weight gain.\nIt has one of the least probabilities of causing extrapyramidal side-effects.

Although it is usually referred to as a nonspecific antagonist, there is indirect evidence for m1-receptor subtype specificity.

(initially called BAY 12-8039). It is marketed worldwide (as the hydrochloride) under the brand names Avelox, Avalox, and Avelon for oral treatment. In most countries, the drug is also available in parenteral form for intravenous infusion. Moxifloxacin is also sold in an ophthalmic solution (eye drops) under the brand names Vigamox, and Moxeza for the treatment of conjunctivitis (pink eye). Its antibacterial spectrum includes enteric Gram-(\u2212) rods (Escherichia coli, Proteus species, Klebsiella species), Haemophilus influenzae, atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Legionella), and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and anaerobic bacteria. It differs from earlier antibacterials of the fluoroquinolone class such as levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in having greater activity against Gram-(+) bacteria and anaerobes. Because of its potent activity against the common respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, it is considered a \"respiratory quinolone.\"\nA United States patent application was submitted on 30 June 1989, for Avelox (moxifloxacin hydrochloride). In 1999 Avelox was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States.\nIn the United States, moxifloxacin is licensed for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community acquired pneumonia, complicated and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, and complicated intra-abdominal infections. In the European Union, it is licensed for acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, non-severe community-acquired pneumonia, and acute bacterial sinusitis. Based on its investigation into reports of rare but severe cases of liver toxicity and skin reactions, the European Medicines Agency recommended in 2008 that the use of the oral (but not the IV) form of moxifloxacin be restricted to infections in which other antibacterial agents cannot be used or have failed. In the US, the marketing approval does not contain these restrictions, though the label contains prominent warnings against skin reactions.\nAvelox (moxifloxacin) was launched in the United States in 1999 and is currently marketed in more than 80 countries worldwide. In the United States, Avelox is marketed by Bayer's partner Merck.\nIn 2011 the FDA added two boxed warnings for this drug in reference to spontaneous tendon ruptures and the fact that moxifloxacin may cause worsening of myasthenia gravis symptoms, including muscle weakness and life-threatening breathing problems.", "name": "moxifloxacin"}, {"vec": [1.357092694834489, 8.582662113492434], "type": "dx", "description": "Narcolepsy, with cataplexy", "name": "Narcolepsy, with cataplexy (ICD-9 347.01)"}, {"vec": [4.020287830941809, -1.8178746320129024], "type": "dx", "description": "Rheumatoid arthritis", "name": "Rheumatoid arthritis (ICD-9 714.0)"}, {"vec": [3.4371621900659335, 5.883402055179531], "type": "dx", "description": "Osteoarthrosis, localized, primary, forearm", "name": "Osteoarthrosis, localized, primary, forearm (ICD-9 715.13)"}, {"vec": [11.39421070330871, -2.1476609461568374], "type": "rx", "description": "Formoterol (INN) or eformoterol (former BAN) is a long-acting \u03b22 agonist used in the management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars, sodalite and rock salt (NaCl). Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble. Sodium ions have been leached by the action of water so that sodium and chlorine (Cl) are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the Earth's bodies of oceanic water.\nMany sodium compounds are useful, such as sodium hydroxide (lye) for soap-making, and sodium chloride for use as a de-icing agent and a nutrient (edible salt). Sodium is an essential element for all animals and some plants.

Common trade names in English-speaking markets are Tylenol and Panadol.\nParacetamol is classified as a mild analgesic. It is commonly used for the relief of headaches and other minor aches and pains and is a major ingredient in numerous cold and flu remedies. In combination with opioid analgesics, paracetamol can also be used in the management of more severe pain such as post-surgical and cancer pain. Though paracetamol is used to treat inflammatory pain, it is not generally classified as an NSAID because it exhibits only weak anti-inflammatory activity.\nWhile generally safe for use at recommended doses, even small overdoses can be fatal. Compared to other over-the-counter pain relievers, paracetamol is significantly more toxic in overdose but may be less toxic when used chronically at recommended doses.

However, unlike phenacetin, acetanilide and their combinations, paracetamol is not considered carcinogenic at therapeutic doses.\nThe words acetaminophen (used in the United States, Canada, Japan, Venezuela, and Colombia) and paracetamol (used elsewhere) both come from a chemical name for the compound: para-acetylaminophenol and para-acetylaminophenol.

Aspirin also has an antiplatelet effect by inhibiting the production of thromboxane, which under normal circumstances binds platelet molecules together to create a patch over damaged walls of blood vessels. Because the platelet patch can become too large and also block blood flow, locally and downstream, aspirin is also used long-term, at low doses, to help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and blood clot formation in people at high risk of developing blood clots. Also, low doses of aspirin may be given immediately after a heart attack to reduce the risk of another heart attack or of the death of cardiac tissue. Aspirin may be effective at preventing certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.\nThe main side effects of aspirin are gastrointestinal ulcers, stomach bleeding, and ringing in the ears, especially with higher doses. In children and adolescents, aspirin is not recommended for flu-like symptoms or viral illnesses, because of the risk of Reye's syndrome.\nAspirin is part of a group of medications called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but differs from most other NSAIDs in the mechanism of action. Though it and others with similar structure, called the salicylates, have similar effects (antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic) to the other NSAIDs and inhibit the same enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), aspirin does so in an irreversible manner and, unlike others, affects more the COX-1 variant than the COX-2 variant of the enzyme.\nAspirin is based on salicylin, a chemical found in the bark of the willow tree. The therapeutic properties of willow tree bark have been known for at least 2,400 years, with Hippocrates prescribing it for headaches. Bark containing salicin was used by the Romans and American Indians to treat cold, flu, aches, pains and infections. Salicylic acid, the active ingredient of aspirin, was first discovered from the bark of the willow tree in 1763 by Edward Stone of Wadham College, University of Oxford. Felix Hoffmann, a chemist with the German company Bayer, is credited with the synthesis of aspirin in 1897, though whether this was of his own initiative or under the direction of Arthur Eichengr\u00fcn is controversial. Many historians believe Arthur Eichengr\u00fcn to be the true inventor. Aspirin is one of the most widely used medications in the world, with an estimated 40,000 tonnes of it being consumed each year. In countries where \"Aspirin\" is a registered trademark owned by Bayer, the generic term is acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).

Natalizumab has proven effective in treating the symptoms of both diseases, preventing relapse, vision loss, cognitive decline and significantly improving quality of life in people with multiple sclerosis, as well as increasing rates of remission and preventing relapse in Crohn's disease.\nNatalizumab was approved in 2004 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after years of testing. It was subsequently withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer after it was linked with three cases of the rare neurological condition progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) when administered in combination with interferon beta-1a, another immunosuppressive drug often used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. After a review of safety information and no further deaths, the drug was returned to the US market in 2006 under a special prescription program. As of June 2009, ten cases of PML were known. However, twenty-four cases of PML had been reported since its reintroduction by October 2009, showing a sharp rise in the number of fatalities and prompting a review of the chemical for human use by the European Medicines Agency. By January 2010, 31 cases of PML were attributed to natalizumab. The FDA did not withdraw the drug from the market because its clinical benefits outweigh the risks involved.

About 60% of people improve with any given NSAID and it is recommended that if one does not work that another should be tried. Ibuprofen might be considered a weaker anti-inflammatory than other NSAIDs.\nCompared to other NSAIDs it may have fewer side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding. At low doses it does not appear to increase the risk of myocardial infarction; however, at higher doses it may. It may result in worsened asthma.\nLike other NSAIDs, it works by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are fat-like molecules derived from arachidonic acid, which are involved in mediating inflammation (swelling), pain, and fever. It achieves this effect on prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, an enzyme that is present in various tissues of the body.\nIt was originally made and patented in 1961, by the research arm of Boots Company led by Stewart Adams and marketed as Brufen. Ibuprofen is now available under a variety of trade names, with the most notable being Advil, Motrin, and Nurofen. Its discovery was the result of research during the 1950s and 1960s to find a safer alternative to aspirin. It was later marketed, in 1966, as a prescription drug in the United Kingdom, then the United States in 1974. Later in 1983 and 1984, it became the first NSAID (other than aspirin) to be available over the counter (OTC) in these two countries.

This is further evidenced by carisoprodol's ability to maintain relevant benefits when administered 3-4 times a day despite its short half-life of only two hours.", "name": "carisoprodol"}, {"vec": [-6.8018659460353526, -6.831648294998834], "type": "dx", "description": "Closed fracture of unspecified part of neck of femur", "name": "Closed fracture of unspecified part of neck of femur (ICD-9 820.8)"}, {"vec": [10.789008264631002, -0.3260402110707185], "type": "rx", "description": "Dextropropoxyphene is an analgesic in the opioid category, patented in 1955 and manufactured by Eli Lilly and Company.

The drug has been taken off the market in Europe and the US due to concerns of fatal overdoses and heart arrhythmias. Its onset of analgesia (pain relief) is said to be 20\u201330 minutes and peak effects are seen about 1.5\u20132 hours after oral administration.\nDextropropoxyphene is sometimes combined with acetaminophen or aspirin.

It is a shiny gray solid which bears a close physical resemblance to the other five elements in the second column (Group 2, or alkaline earth metals) of the periodic table: they each have the same electron configuration in their outer electron shell producing a similar crystal structure.\nMagnesium is the ninth most abundant element in the universe. It is synthesized in large, aging stars from the sequential addition of three helium nuclei to a carbon nucleus. When such a star explodes as a supernova, much of its magnesium is expelled into the interstellar medium, where it can be recycled into new star systems. Consequently, magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the Earth's crust and the fourth most common element in the Earth (below iron, oxygen and silicon), making up 13% of the planet's mass and a large fraction of the planet's mantle. It is the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater, after sodium and chlorine.\nMagnesium only occurs naturally in combination with other elements, where it invariably has a +2 oxidation state. The free element (metal) can be produced artificially, and is highly reactive (though once produced, it is coated in a thin layer of oxide, which partly inhibits this reactivity \u2014 see passivation). The free metal burns with a characteristic brilliant-white light, making it a useful ingredient in flares. The metal is now obtained mainly by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained from brine. In commerce, the chief use for the metal is as an alloying agent to make aluminium-magnesium alloys, sometimes called magnalium or magnelium. Since magnesium is less dense than aluminium, this alloy is prized for its properties of lightness combined with strength.\nMagnesium is the eleventh most abundant element by mass in the human body. Its ions are essential to all cells. They interact with polyphosphate compounds such as ATP, DNA, and RNA. Hundreds of enzymes require magnesium ions to function. Magnesium compounds are used medicinally as common laxatives, antacids (e.g., milk of magnesia), and to stabilize abnormal nerve excitation or blood vessel spasm such as in eclampsia. Magnesium ions are sour to the taste, and in low concentrations they help impart a natural tartness to fresh mineral waters. Magnesium is the metallic ion at the center of chlorophyll, and is a common additive to fertilizers.", "name": "magnesium"}, {"vec": [-10.705936092358646, -7.067749381281941], "type": "dx", "description": "Malignant hypertensive heart disease without heart failure", "name": "Malignant hypertensive heart disease without heart failure (ICD-9 402)"}, {"vec": [4.646571971464136, 8.684239629436181], "type": "provider specialty", "description": "Provider specialty of neurodevelopmental disabilities", "name": "neurodevelopmental disabilities"}, {"vec": [2.1906731798778365, -7.9031446042386735], "type": "dx", "description": "Chronic prostatitis", "name": "Chronic prostatitis (ICD-9 601.1)"}, {"vec": [4.792693319103408, 1.5796677446670033], "type": "dx", "description": "Disorganized type schizophrenia, chronic", "name": "Disorganized type schizophrenia, chronic (ICD-9 295.12)"}, {"vec": [0.4403981006995645, -7.630272796052293], "type": "dx", "description": "Other diseases of spleen", "name": "Other diseases of spleen (ICD-9 289.59)"}, {"vec": [1.892534803006541, -5.650981272666908], "type": "dx", "description": "Unspecified gastritis and gastroduodenitis, without mention of hemorrhage", "name": "Unspecified gastritis and gastroduodenitis, without mention of hemorrhage (ICD-9 535.5)"}, {"vec": [-5.44482408002331, -7.445727903174989], "type": "dx", "description": "Defibrination syndrome", "name": "Defibrination syndrome (ICD-9 286.6)"}, {"vec": [-0.8276662007883958, -4.446274609769256], "type": "dx", "description": "Atypical face pain", "name": "Atypical face pain (ICD-9 350.2)"}, {"vec": [-1.977540200912092, -1.1029367437543647], "type": "dx", "description": "Hypersomnia with sleep apnea, unspecified", "name": "Hypersomnia with sleep apnea, unspecified (ICD-9 780.53)"}, {"vec": [0.4586530296606425, -1.766225450243081], "type": "dx", "description": "Separation anxiety disorder", "name": "Separation anxiety disorder (ICD-9 309.21)"}, {"vec": [-6.638460793684754, -1.295748466893561], "type": "dx", "description": "Osteoarthrosis, generalized, hand", "name": "Osteoarthrosis, generalized, hand (ICD-9 715.04)"}, {"vec": [-7.068830741887261, 1.5086997140887835], "type": "dx", "description": "Helicobacter pylori [H. pylori]", "name": "Helicobacter pylori [H. pylori] (ICD-9 041.86)"}, {"vec": [-6.331488776870463, 1.6767425451216291], "type": "dx", "description": "Osteoarthrosis, generalized, site unspecified", "name": "Osteoarthrosis, generalized, site unspecified (ICD-9 715.00)"}, {"vec": [-9.706116223668175, -0.039784757279900045], "type": "dx", "description": "Acute hepatitis C without mention of hepatic coma", "name": "Acute hepatitis C without mention of hepatic coma (ICD-9 070.51)"}, {"vec": [3.4452905005261196, -0.9029528214466319], "type": "dx", "description": "Cannabis dependence, unspecified", "name": "Cannabis dependence, unspecified (ICD-9 304.3)"}, {"vec": [-0.6516484982746912, -1.5309171951389209], "type": "dx", "description": "Localization-related (focal) (partial) epilepsy and epileptic syndromes with simple partial seizures, without mention of intractable epilepsy", "name": "Localization-related (focal) (partial) epilepsy and epileptic syndromes with simple partial seizures, without mention of intractable epilepsy (ICD-9 345.50)"}, {"vec": [9.184913366582766, -2.957026020865586], "type": "rx", "description": "Iron(III) fluoride, also known as ferric fluoride, is an inorganic compound.

In humans, the most important compounds in this group are vitamin D3 (also known as cholecalciferol) and vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol). Cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol can be ingested from the diet and from supplements. Very few foods contain vitamin D; synthesis of vitamin D (specifically cholecalciferol) in the skin is the major natural source of the vitamin. Dermal synthesis of vitamin D from cholesterol is dependent on sun exposure (specifically UVB radiation).\nVitamin D from the diet or dermal synthesis from sunlight is biologically inactive; activation requires enzymatic conversion (hydroxylation) in the liver and kidney. Evidence indicates the synthesis of vitamin D from sun exposure is regulated by a negative feedback loop that prevents toxicity, but because of uncertainty about the cancer risk from sunlight, no recommendations are issued by the Institute of Medicine (US), for the amount of sun exposure required to meet vitamin D requirements. Accordingly, the Dietary Reference Intake for vitamin D assumes no synthesis occurs and all of a person's vitamin D is from food intake, although that will rarely occur in practice. As vitamin D is synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sunlight, it is not strictly a vitamin, and may be considered a hormone as its synthesis and activity occur in different locations. Vitamin D has a significant role in calcium homeostasis and metabolism. Its discovery was due to effort to find the dietary substance lacking in rickets (the childhood form of osteomalacia).\nBeyond its use to prevent osteomalacia or rickets, the evidence for other health effects of vitamin D supplementation in the general population is inconsistent. The best evidence of benefit is for bone health. The effect of vitamin D supplementation on mortality is not clear, with one meta-analysis finding a decrease in mortality in elderly people, and another concluding no clear justification exists for recommending vitamin D. Because it found mounting evidence for a benefit to bone health, though it had not found good evidence of other benefits, the Food and Drug Administration of the United States intends to begin requiring manufacturers to declare the amount of Vitamin D on nutrition facts labels, as \"nutrients of public health significance\".\nIn the liver, cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is converted to calcidiol, which is also known as calcifediol (INN), 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (aka 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 \u2014 abbreviated 25(OH)D3). Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) is converted in the liver to 25-hydroxyergocalciferol (aka 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 \u2014 abbreviated 25(OH)D2). These two specific vitamin D metabolites are measured in serum to determine a person's vitamin D status. Part of the calcidiol is converted by the kidneys to calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D. Calcitriol circulates as a hormone in the blood, regulating the concentration of calcium and phosphate in the bloodstream and promoting the healthy growth and remodeling of bone. Calcitriol also affects neuromuscular and immune function.", "name": "calcium-vitamin d"}, {"vec": [2.0242875154961424, -1.1618707383922249], "type": "dx", "description": "Infantile spasms, without mention of intractable epilepsy", "name": "Infantile spasms, without mention of intractable epilepsy (ICD-9 345.6)"}, {"vec": [-0.2402594912712511, -3.1696178324452027], "type": "dx", "description": "Respiratory malfunction arising from mental factors", "name": "Respiratory malfunction arising from mental factors (ICD-9 306.1)"}, {"vec": [-9.129057238045853, 6.466667279700578], "type": "dx", "description": "Critical illness polyneuropathy", "name": "Critical illness polyneuropathy (ICD-9 357.82)"}, {"vec": [-4.058784087892698, 9.387303530531891], "type": "dx", "description": "Acquired deformity of nose", "name": "Acquired deformity of nose (ICD-9 738.0)"}, {"vec": [8.160048741046019, 1.0778043124458772], "type": "rx", "description": "Hydromorphone, a more common synonym for dihydromorphinone (not to be confused with dihydromorphine, which is a different derivative of the morphine family), commonly a hydrochloride (brand names Palladone, Dilaudid, and numerous others) is a very potent centrally acting analgesic drug of the opioid class. It is a derivative of morphine; to be specific, a hydrogenated ketone thereof, and comparatively, hydromorphone is to morphine as hydrocodone is to codeine and, therefore, a semi-synthetic drug. It is in medical terms an opioid analgesic and in legal terms a narcotic. Hydromorphone is commonly used in the hospital setting, mostly intravenously (IV) because its bioavailability orally, rectally, and intranasally is very low. Sublingual administration (under the tongue) is usually superior to swallowing for bioavailability and effects, however hydromorphone, like most opiates, is bitter and hydrophilic, not lipophilic, so is absorbed poorly/slowly through mouth membranes.\nHydromorphone is much more soluble in water than morphine and therefore hydromorphone solutions can be produced to deliver the drug in a smaller volume of water. The hydrochloride salt is soluble in three parts of water whereas a gram of morphine hydrochloride dissolves in 16 ml of water; for all common purposes the pure powder for hospital use can be used to produce solutions of virtually arbitrary concentration. When the powder has appeared on the street, this very small volume of powder needed for a dose means that overdoses are likely for those who mistake it for heroin or other powdered narcotics, especially those that have been cut or 'stepped on' already.\nVery small quantities of hydromorphone are detected in assays of opium on rare occasions; it appears to be produced by the plant under circumstances and by processes which are not understood at this time and may include the action of bacteria. A similar process and/or other metabolic processes in the plant may very well be responsible for the very low quantities of hydrocodone also found on rare occasions in opium and alkaloid mixtures derived therefrom; dihydrocodeine, oxymorphol, oxycodone, oxymorphone, metopon and possibly other derivatives of morphine and/or hydromorphone also are found in trace amounts in opium.", "name": "hydromorphone"}, {"vec": [4.146202276980037, 1.4881151634055427], "type": "dx", "description": "Acquired spondylolisthesis", "name": "Acquired spondylolisthesis (ICD-9 738.4)"}, {"vec": [-5.479628612431617, 9.166898458023367], "type": "dx", "description": "Acute lymphadenitis", "name": "Acute lymphadenitis (ICD-9 683.)"}, {"vec": [-6.060997404124533, 1.1210584068008327], "type": "dx", "description": "Swelling of limb", "name": "Swelling of limb (ICD-9 729.81)"}, {"vec": [-0.2818550648601256, 5.866512375310842], "type": "dx", "description": "Sprain of calcaneofibular (ligament) of ankle", "name": "Sprain of calcaneofibular (ligament) of ankle (ICD-9 845.02)"}, {"vec": [7.433222582570929, 5.367349340993871], "type": "dx", "description": "Sprain of ankle, unspecified site", "name": "Sprain of ankle, unspecified site (ICD-9 845.00)"}, {"vec": [7.8380358286449505, -1.215230059140371], "type": "rx", "description": "Ropinirole (INN; trade names Requip, Repreve, Ronirol, Adartrel) is a dopamine agonist of the non-ergoline class of medications.

It has U.S. F.D.A. approval to treat rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. TNF-alpha is the \"master regulator\" of the inflammatory (immune) response in many organ systems. Autoimmune diseases are caused by an overactive immune response. Etanercept has the potential to treat these diseases by inhibiting TNF-alpha.\nEtanercept is a fusion protein produced by recombinant DNA. It fuses the TNF receptor to the constant end of the IgG1 antibody. First, the developers isolated the DNA sequence that codes the human gene for soluble TNF receptor 2, which is a receptor that binds to tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Second, they isolated the DNA sequence that codes the human gene for the Fc end of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). Third, they linked the DNA for TNF receptor 2 to the DNA for IgG1 Fc. Finally, they expressed the linked DNA to produce a protein that links the protein for TNF receptor 2 to the protein for IgG1 Fc.\nThe prototypic fusion protein was first synthesized and shown to be highly active and unusually stable as a modality for blockade of TNF in vivo in the early 1990s by Bruce A. Beutler, an academic researcher then at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, and his colleagues. These investigators also patented the protein, selling all rights to its use to Immunex, a biotechnology company that was acquired by Amgen in 2002.\nIt is a large molecule, with a molecular weight of 150 kDa., that binds to TNF\u03b1 and decreases its role in disorders involving excess inflammation in humans and other animals, including autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and, potentially, in a variety of other disorders mediated by excess TNF\u03b1.\nIn North America, etanercept is co-marketed by Amgen and Pfizer under the trade name Enbrel in two separate formulations, one in powder form, the other as a pre-mixed liquid.

It kills gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria by disrupting the growth of the bacterial cell wall. Cefalexin is a beta-lactam antibiotic within the class of first-generation cephalosporins. It works similarly to other agents within this class, including intravenous cefazolin, but can be taken by mouth.\nCefalexin can treat certain bacterial infections, including those of the middle ear, bone and joint, skin, and urinary tract. It may also be used for certain types of pneumonia, strep throat, and to prevent bacterial endocarditis. Cefalexin is not effective against infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus, or Pseudomonas. Like other antibiotics, cefalexin cannot treat viral infections, such as the flu, common cold or acute bronchitis. Cefalexin can be used in those who have mild or moderate allergies to penicillin. However, it is not recommended in those with severe penicillin allergies.\nCommon side effects include upset stomach and diarrhea. An allergic reaction and infection with Clostridium difficile, a type of diarrhea, is also possible. To date, no evidence of harm to the baby has been found when used during pregnancy or breast feeding. It can be used in children and those over 65 years of age. Those with kidney problems may require a decrease in dose.\nIn 2012, cefalexin was one of the top 100 most prescribed medications in the United States. In Canada, it was the 5th most common antibiotic used in 2013. In Australia, it is one of the top 15 most prescribed medications.

It is a strong agonist at the \u03bc-opioid receptors. Historically, it has been used to treat breakthrough pain and is commonly used in pre-procedures as a pain reliever as well as an anesthetic in combination with a benzodiazepine.\nFentanyl is approximately 80 to 100 times more potent than morphine and roughly 40 to 50 times more potent than pharmaceutical grade (100% pure) heroin.\nFentanyl was first synthesized by Paul Janssen in 1960 following the medical inception of pethidine several years earlier. Janssen developed fentanyl by assaying analogues of the structurally related drug pethidine for opioid activity. The widespread use of fentanyl triggered the production of fentanyl citrate (the salt formed by combining fentanyl and citric acid in a 1:1 stoichiometry), which entered the clinical practice as a general anaesthetic under the trade name Sublimaze in the 1960s. Following this, many other fentanyl analogues were developed and introduced into medical practice, including sufentanil, alfentanil, remifentanil, and lofentanil.\nIn the mid-1990s, fentanyl was first introduced for widespread palliative use with the clinical introduction of the Duragesic patch, followed in the next decade by the introduction of the first quick-acting prescription formulations of fentanyl for personal use, the Actiq lollipop and Fentora buccal tablets. Through the delivery method of transdermal patches, as of 2012 fentanyl was the most widely used synthetic opioid in clinical practice, with several new delivery methods now available, including a sublingual spray for cancer patients.

It is a soft, silver-white metal belonging to the alkali metal group of chemical elements. Under standard conditions it is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable. For this reason, it is typically stored in mineral oil. When cut open, it exhibits a metallic luster, but contact with moist air corrodes the surface quickly to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. Because of its high reactivity, lithium never occurs freely in nature, and instead, only appears in compounds, which are usually ionic. Lithium occurs in a number of pegmatitic minerals, but due to its solubility as an ion, is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines and clays. On a commercial scale, lithium is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\nThe nuclei of lithium verge on instability, since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though the nuclei are very light in atomic weight. For related reasons, lithium has important links to nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully man-made nuclear reaction, and lithium-6 deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.\nLithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium batteries and lithium-ion batteries. These uses consume more than three quarters of lithium production.\nTrace amounts of lithium are present in all organisms. The element serves no apparent vital biological function, since animals and plants survive in good health without it. Non-vital functions have not been ruled out.

Marketed as Wellbutrin and other trade names, it is one of the most frequently prescribed antidepressants in the United States, although in many English-speaking countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, this is an off-label use. It is also widely used, in a formulation marketed as Zyban, to aid people who are trying to quit smoking. Bupropion is consumed in tablet form and is available only by prescription in most countries.\nClinically, bupropion serves as an atypical antidepressant fundamentally different from most commonly prescribed antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It is an effective antidepressant on its own, but is also popular as an add-on medication in cases of incomplete response to first-line SSRI antidepressants. In contrast to many other antidepressants, it does not cause weight gain or sexual dysfunction. The most important side effect is an increase in risk for epileptic seizures, which caused the drug to be withdrawn from the market for some time and then caused the recommended dosage to be reduced.\nBupropion is known to affect several different biological targets, and its mechanism of action is only partly understood. It has been widely described in the literature as a weak norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). However, this is not entirely accurate. There is evidence that bupropion induces the release of norepinephrine and dopamine in addition to inhibiting their reuptake, similarly to other cathinones like amfepramone (diethylpropion). Moreover, studies with humans via the oral administration route have demonstrated that bupropion does not significantly affect dopamine levels in the brain at clinically-used doses, indicating that its in vitro capacity to inhibit the reuptake and induce the release of dopamine is not involved in its clinical effects. This finding can be reasonably explained by extensive first-pass metabolism of bupropion into metabolites with differing pharmacology \u2013 namely, selective noradrenergic action without dopaminergic effect. In addition to its monoaminergic actions, bupropion and its metabolites act as non-competitive antagonists of several neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nACh receptors), a property which appears to be importantly involved in both the antidepressant effects of bupropion and its efficacy in smoking cessation. Chemically, bupropion belongs to the class of aminoketones and is similar in structure to stimulants such as cathinone and amfepramone, and to phenethylamines in general.\nBupropion was synthesized by Nariman Mehta and patented by Burroughs Wellcome in 1969, which later became part of what is now GlaxoSmithKline. It was first approved for clinical use in the United States in 1989. It was originally called by the generic name amfebutamone, before being renamed in 2000. Its chemical name is 3-chloro-N-tert-butyl-\u03b2-ketoamphetamine.

Estradiol is essential for the development and maintenance of female reproductive tissues but it also has important effects in many other tissues including bone. While estrogen levels in men are lower compared to women, estrogens have essential functions in men as well. Estradiol is found in most vertebrates as well as many crustaceans, insects, fish, and other animal species.\nEstradiol or oestradiol (American or British English usages), derives from estra-, Gk. \u03bf\u1f36\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (oistros, literally meaning \"verve or inspiration\") and -diol, a chemical name and suffix indicating that this form of steroid and sex hormone is a type of alcohol bearing two hydroxyl groups.\nEstradiol is produced especially within the follicles of female ovaries, but also in other endocrine (i.e., hormone-producing) and non-endocrine tissues (e.g., including fat, liver, adrenal, breast, and neural tissues). Estradiol is biosynthesized from progesterone (arrived at in two steps from cholesterol, via intermediate pregnenolone). One principle pathway then converts progesterone to its 17-hydroxy-derivative, and then to androstenedione via sequential cytochrome P450-catalyzed oxidations.

First synthesized on December 11, 1951, chlorpromazine was the first drug developed with specific antipsychotic action and would serve as the prototype for the phenothiazine class of drugs, which comprises several other agents. The introduction of chlorpromazine during the 1950s has been described as the single greatest advance in the history of psychiatric care, improving the prognosis of people in psychiatric hospitals.\nChlorpromazine works on a variety of receptors in the central nervous system, producing potent anticholinergic, antidopaminergic, antihistaminic, and antiadrenergic effects. Both the clinical indications and side effect profile of CPZ are determined by the broadness of its action: its anticholinergic properties cause constipation, sedation, and hypotension but also help relieve nausea. It also has anxiolytic (anxiety-relieving) properties. Its antidopaminergic properties can cause extrapyramidal symptoms, such as akathisia (restlessness, where the patient walks almost constantly, despite having nowhere to go due to mandatory confinement) and dystonia. It is known to cause tardive dyskinesia, which can be irreversible. In acute settings, it is often administered as a syrup, which has a faster onset of action than tablets, and it can also be given by intramuscular injection.

It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in 2010. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, and amnestic properties. Alprazolam is available for oral administration in compressed tablet (CT) and extended-release capsule (XR) formulations.\nAlprazolam has a fast onset of action and symptomatic relief. Ninety percent of peak effects are achieved within the first hour of using either the CT formulation or the XR formulation in preparation for panic disorder, and full peak effects are achieved in 1.5 and 1.6 hours respectively. Peak benefits achieved for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) may take up to a week. Tolerance to the anxiolytic/antipanic effects is controversial with some authoritative sources reporting the development of tolerance, and others reporting no development of tolerance; tolerance will however, develop to the sedative-hypnotic effects within a couple of days. Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing treatment abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction.\nAlprazolam was first released by Upjohn (now a part of Pfizer). It is covered under U.S. Patent 3,987,052, which was filed on 29 October 1969, granted on 19 October 1976, and expired in September 1993. Alprazolam was released in 1981. The first approved indication was panic disorder and within two years of its original marketing Upjohn's Xanax became a blockbuster drug in the US. Presently, Alprazolam is the most prescribed and the most misused benzodiazepine on the U.S. retail market. The potential for misuse among those taking it for medical reasons is controversial with some expert reviews stating that the risk is low and similar to that of other benzodiazepine drugs and others stating that there is a substantial risk of misuse and dependence in both patients and non-medical users of alprazolam and that the pharmacological properties of alprazolam, high affinity binding, high potency, having a short elimination half-life as well as a rapid onset of action may increase the misuse potential of alprazolam. Compared to the large number of prescriptions, relatively few individuals increase their dose on their own initiative or engage in drug-seeking behavior.

An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) is called a vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, and it must be obtained through the diet; thus, the term \"vitamin\" is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animal organisms. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems, but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by otherwise healthy people.\nBy convention, the term vitamin includes neither other essential nutrients, such as dietary minerals, essential fatty acids, or essential amino acids (which are needed in greater amounts than vitamins) nor the great number of other nutrients that promote health, and are required less often to maintain the health of the organism. Thirteen vitamins are universally recognized at present. Vitamins are classified by their biological and chemical activity, not their structure. Thus, each \"vitamin\" refers to a number of vitamer compounds that all show the biological activity associated with a particular vitamin. Such a set of chemicals is grouped under an alphabetized vitamin \"generic descriptor\" title, such as \"vitamin A\", which includes the compounds retinal, retinol, and four known carotenoids. Vitamers by definition are convertible to the active form of the vitamin in the body, and are sometimes inter-convertible to one another, as well.\nVitamins have diverse biochemical functions. Some, such as vitamin D, have hormone-like functions as regulators of mineral metabolism, or regulators of cell and tissue growth and differentiation (such as some forms of vitamin A). Others function as antioxidants (e.g., vitamin E and sometimes vitamin C). The largest number of vitamins, the B complex vitamins, function as precursors for enzyme cofactors, that help enzymes in their work as catalysts in metabolism. In this role, vitamins may be tightly bound to enzymes as part of prosthetic groups: For example, biotin is part of enzymes involved in making fatty acids. They may also be less tightly bound to enzyme catalysts as coenzymes, detachable molecules that function to carry chemical groups or electrons between molecules. For example, folic acid may carry methyl, formyl, and methylene groups in the cell. Although these roles in assisting enzyme-substrate reactions are vitamins' best-known function, the other vitamin functions are equally important.\nUntil the mid-1930s, when the first commercial yeast-extract vitamin B complex and semi-synthetic vitamin C supplement tablets were sold, vitamins were obtained solely through food intake, and changes in diet (which, for example, could occur during a particular growing season) usually greatly altered the types and amounts of vitamins ingested. However, vitamins have been produced as commodity chemicals and made widely available as inexpensive semisynthetic and synthetic-source multivitamin dietary and food supplements and additives, since the middle of the 20th century. Study of structural activity, function and their role in maintaining health is called as vitaminology.", "name": "vitamin"}, {"vec": [10.80383864562569, -1.7545565767760132], "type": "rx", "description": "Thiamine, thiamin or vitamin B1 (/\u02c8\u03b8a\u026a.\u0259m\u0268n/ THY-\u0259-min), named as the \"thio-vitamine\" (\"sulfur-containing vitamin\") is a vitamin of the B complex. First named aneurin for the detrimental neurological effects if not present in the diet, it was eventually assigned the generic descriptor name vitamin B1. Its phosphate derivatives are involved in many cellular processes. The best-characterized form is thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), a coenzyme in the catabolism of sugars and amino acids. In yeast, TPP is also required in the first step of alcoholic fermentation.\nAll living organisms use thiamine, but it is synthesized only in bacteria, fungi, and plants. Animals must obtain it from their diet, and thus, for humans, it is an essential nutrient. Insufficient intake in birds produces a characteristic polyneuritis. In mammals, deficiency results in Korsakoff's syndrome, optic neuropathy, and a disease called beriberi that affects the peripheral nervous system (polyneuritis) and/or the cardiovascular system. Thiamine deficiency has a potentially fatal outcome if it remains untreated.

In humans and other mammals, testosterone is secreted primarily by the testicles of males and, to a lesser extent, the ovaries of females. Small amounts are also secreted by the adrenal glands. It is the principal male sex hormone and an anabolic steroid.\nIn men, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as the testis and prostate as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle, bone mass, and the growth of body hair. In addition, testosterone is essential for health and well-being as well as the prevention of osteoporosis.\nOn average, in adult males, levels of testosterone are about 7\u20138 times as great as in adult females. As the metabolic consumption of testosterone in males is greater, the daily production is about 20 times greater in men. Females are also more sensitive to the hormone.
